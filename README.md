# Build a REST API With Laravel & Sanctum

This is a practice project for Laravel that includes the following steps:

- First, I installed a blank Laravel project.
- Then, I designed and created seeders and factories. In this part, I learned about the enum data type that can be used as predefined data in the database and we can only choose from the options that we have defined before.
- Next, I defined the routes.
- After that, I learned about resources and collections.
- Then, I added the ability to filter and search among the existing data.
- Next, I improved the filtering system and added the invoice model to it.
- Then, I was able to retrieve the invoices related to customers with the with method.
- Next, I prepared the requests for inserting data.
- Then, I implemented the system for updating the previous data.
- Next, I added data to the database in bulk.
- Finally, I implemented the authentication and access system using sanctum.
